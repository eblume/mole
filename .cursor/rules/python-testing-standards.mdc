Test Organization:

1. Place all test files in tests/ directory
2. Name test files with test_ prefix
3. For integration tests:
 - Use @pytest.mark.skipif with environment variables
 - Document required credentials/API keys
 - Enable integration mode by setting the environment variable `INTEGRATION_MODE` to 'true'
4. Structure:
 - Each test module should be filled with similar tests testing similar components.
 - Use clear, descriptive test function names
 - Include implementation details in comments
5. Running Tests:
 - Run all tests using `uv run pytest`
 - Run a specific test using `uv run pytest tests/<test_file.py>::<test_function>`
 - Run tests with integration mode enabled using `INTEGRATION_MODE=true uv run pytest`
 - You can use --pdb to debug, and `breakpoint()` in the code to set breakpoints
