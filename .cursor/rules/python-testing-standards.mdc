      Test Organization:
      1. Place all test files in tests/ directory
      2. Name test files with test_ prefix
      3. For integration tests:
         - Use @pytest.mark.skipif with environment variables
         - Document required credentials/API keys
         - Enable integration mode by setting the environment variable `INTEGRATION_MODE` to 'true'
      4. Structure:
         - Focus each test file on specific feature/component
         - Use clear, descriptive test function names
         - Include implementation details in comments
      5. Running Tests:
         - Run all tests using `uv run pytest`
         - Run a specific test using `uv run pytest tests/<test_file.py>::<test_function>`
         - Run tests with integration mode enabled using `INTEGRATION_MODE=true uv run pytest`
