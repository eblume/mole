      Test Organization:
      1. Place all test files in tests/ directory
      2. Name test files with test_ prefix
      3. For integration tests:
         - Use @pytest.mark.skipif with environment variables
         - Document required credentials/API keys
      4. Structure:
         - Focus each test file on specific feature/component
         - Use clear, descriptive test function names
         - Include implementation details in comments

examples:
  - input: |
      # Good test file structure
      tests/
      ├── test_basic.py
      ├── test_todoist_integration.py
      └── ...
