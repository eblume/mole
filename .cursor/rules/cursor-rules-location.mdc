# Cursor Rules Location

Rules for placing and organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

When creating Cursor rules:

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
 ```
 .cursor/rules/
 ├── your-rule-name.mdc
 ├── another-rule.mdc
 └── ...
 ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
 - Use kebab-case for filenames
 - Always use .mdc extension
 - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
 ```
 PROJECT_ROOT/
 ├── .cursor/
 │   └── rules/
 │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
 │       └── ...
 └── ...
 ```

4. Never place rule files:
 - In the project root
 - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
 - In any other location
